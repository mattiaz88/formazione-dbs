    "\n",
    "Large Language Models are artificial intelligence models trained on enormous amounts of text to understand and generate natural language. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, LLMs learn linguistic patterns directly from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context understanding**: LLMs analyze the meaning of words based on surrounding context\n",
    "- **Coherent generation**: They produce fluid and grammatically correct text\n",
    "- **Multitask**: Can perform various tasks without being reprogrammed\n",
    "- **Few-shot learning**: Learn new tasks with few examples"

    "### Key Takeaways: Embeddings for Agentic Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Understanding**: Embeddings enable our system to understand the meaning of queries, not just keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: We can build a knowledge base that the agent can query intelligently\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: As we add more campaign documentation, embeddings allow efficient semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Foundation for RAG**: This is the basis for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which we'll use in our agentic system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps in the Course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate embeddings with LLMs for more sophisticated responses\n",
    "- Build a vector database for efficient large-scale search\n",
    "- Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns\n",
    "- Use embeddings to help agents decide which tools to use"
